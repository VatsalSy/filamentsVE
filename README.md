# Filaments breakup: effect of viscoelasticity

There are three main codes:
* filament_initialCondition.c: run this code to generate the initial condition for the filament. This code takes a spherical blob and stretches it into a filament. To study the effect of viscoelasticity, starting from an already stretched filament with no conformation will not work. So, we start with a blob and stretch it (with an extremely high Deborah number) into a filament. This way we get a filament with a non-trivial conformation.

* filamentVE.c: starting from the initial condition generated by filament_initialCondition.c, this code studies the effect of viscoelasticity on the filament's breakup. 


## running the codes

There are two ways to run the codes:

1. Using the vanilla basilisk method:

```shell
qcc -O2 -Wall -disable-dimensions filament_initialCondition.c -o filament_initialCondition -lm 
./filament_initialCondition
mv restart restart_init_stretched_filament

qcc -O2 -Wall -disable-dimensions filamentVE.c -o filamentVE -lm
./filamentVE
```

2. Using the makefile (can be interactively run using bview browser):

```shell
CFLAGS=-DDISPLAY=-1 make filament_initialCondition.tst
```
Check the localhost on filament_initialCondition/display.html. something like: [http://basilisk.fr/three.js/editor/index.html?ws://localhost:7100](http://basilisk.fr/three.js/editor/index.html?ws://localhost:7100) and run interactively.

Similarly, once the initial condition is generated, run:

```shell
mv restart restart_init_stretched_filament
CFLAGS=-DDISPLAY=-1 make filamentVE.tst
```
